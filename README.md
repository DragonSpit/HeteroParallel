# HeteroParallel 
Heterogeneous parallel algorithms effort. The idea is to use all of the computational resources of a compute node, such as a desktop computer, laptop
computer or a cloud node. For example, my personal laptop has a quad-core Intel CPU, which has a built-in GPU, and also has an additional NVidia GPU.
The goal is to use all of these computational resources to compute faster.

Join in the effort if you'd like to help out this cause.

Works on Windows using VisualStudio 2017 (version 15.6.6, but for some reason CUDA 9.2 does not work with later versions such as 15.7.6).
